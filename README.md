# HandyHooks

Welcome to HandyHooks, a collection of pre-built Xahau hooks. This repository stores hooks that are available for anyone to use, edit, and distribute. Each hook contains its own README with installation instructions and detailed information.

## What is Xahau?

Xahau is a decentralized platform designed to facilitate secure and efficient transactions. It leverages blockchain technology to provide a transparent and immutable ledger, ensuring the integrity and security of all transactions.

## What are Hooks?

Hooks are small, efficient pieces of code that can be attached to accounts on the Xahau network. They allow users to automate actions based on specific conditions or events, such as forwarding payments, enforcing rules, or triggering notifications. Hooks are written in C and are executed within the Xahau network, providing a powerful way to extend the functionality of the platform.
